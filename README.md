## Improvements to Sublime Text

These two key bindings make Sublime Text + SublimeREPL feel a little more like RStudio which I :heart:

First, install run_multiple_commands.py as a plugin- then run_multiple_commands will work as a command in your key-bindings.

Yes, I know command+r does something else already but that's less important to me than being able to code interactively.

Thanks to Nilium on Sublime Forum for [posting the plugin](https://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=8677#p35524)
